    North Highland’s Approach to Developing an Updated Operating Model for Clients

Introduction

North Highland partners with clients to develop forward-looking strategic plans that articulate a vision for their organization's future success and growth. To achieve this vision, the strategic plan identifies key goals and objectives around themes such as Agility, Diversity, Impact, Innovation, and People-First.

As a critical enabler of the client's mission, the client's IT organization must ensure it is appropriately structured to support the company's future success and growth. This requires an organizational redesign initiative that defines clear roles and responsibilities aligned to the strategic priorities. North Highland partners with the client's IT leadership on this transformation, leveraging our proven Organizational Design Framework and deep experience supporting similar efforts at other public-sector and Fortune 100 clients.

Approach

Our approach begins with Setup and Management, a crucial phase that lays the foundation for a successful organizational redesign initiative. During this phase, we work closely with the client's IT leadership to establish a robust program governance structure. This includes defining clear roles and responsibilities for the core team, identifying key stakeholders across the organization, and establishing regular reporting and communication channels. By aligning on program governance early on, we ensure that the redesign effort has the necessary leadership support, resources, and decision-making processes in place to drive progress and manage risks.

Another key aspect of the Setup and Management phase is identifying and engaging key stakeholders. These stakeholders represent various functions, levels, and perspectives within the client's IT organization and the broader company. Through targeted interviews, focus groups, and surveys, we gather valuable insights into the current state of the organization, including pain points, improvement opportunities, and desired outcomes. By involving stakeholders early and often, we build buy-in and ownership for the redesign effort, which is critical for successful adoption and sustainability of the future state.

With the program governance and stakeholder engagement underway, we then conduct a comprehensive Current State assessment. This assessment provides a detailed understanding of the client's IT organization's existing capabilities, service delivery model, organizational culture, and structure. We review documentation, analyze data, and conduct additional stakeholder interviews to develop a holistic view of the current state.

The capabilities assessment looks at the key functions and services provided by the client's IT organization, evaluating their maturity, effectiveness, and alignment with industry best practices. The service delivery review maps out the current processes, tools, and metrics

used to deliver IT services to the company, identifying opportunities for streamlining and automation. The culture assessment provides insights into the values, behaviors, and norms that shape how work gets done within the client's IT organization, highlighting strengths to build upon and areas for improvement. Finally, the structural assessment looks at the current organizational hierarchy, roles, and responsibilities, identifying any gaps, overlaps, or inefficiencies.

By combining the insights from the Current State assessment with the goals and objectives of the client's Strategic Plan, we develop a set of design principles to guide the future state recommendations. These design principles serve as guardrails to ensure that the redesigned organization is aligned with the company's strategic priorities and values. Example design principles might include customer-centricity, agility, innovation, collaboration, and empowerment. These principles are then used to evaluate and prioritize potential future state options, ensuring that the final recommendations are grounded in both the current realities and the desired future outcomes.

Overall, the Setup and Management and Current State assessment phases are critical for establishing a strong foundation for the organizational redesign effort. By aligning on program governance, engaging stakeholders, and developing a comprehensive understanding of the current state, we can develop targeted and actionable recommendations that position the client's IT organization for success in enabling the company's future growth and impact.

In the Future State design phase, we collaboratively develop a comprehensive Target Operating Model (TOM) that serves as the blueprint for the future client's IT organization. The TOM is a holistic and detailed view of how the client's IT organization will function in the future, aligning people, processes, and technology to deliver on the company's strategic objectives.

One key component of the TOM is the definition of functional capabilities. These are the core areas of expertise and service that the client's IT organization will need to provide to support the company's mission. Examples might include IT strategy and governance, application development and support, infrastructure and operations, cybersecurity, and data management and analytics. For each capability, we define the key activities, outputs, and performance metrics, ensuring that they are aligned with industry best practices and the company's unique needs.

Another critical aspect of the TOM is the design of operating processes. These processes define how work gets done within and across the functional capabilities, ensuring smooth handoffs, clear decision points, and continuous improvement. We map out the end-to-end processes for key IT services, such as incident management, change management, and project delivery, identifying opportunities for simplification, standardization, and automation. By designing efficient and effective operating processes, we enable the

client's IT organization to deliver high-quality services with speed, consistency, and resilience.

The service catalog is another key deliverable in the Future State design phase. The service catalog defines the full range of IT services offered to the company, along with their service levels, pricing, and request processes. By clearly articulating the IT service offerings, we enable better alignment with business needs, improved demand management, and greater transparency and accountability. The service catalog also serves as a foundation for continuous improvement, as the client's IT organization can track service performance and identify areas for optimization over time.

Organizational structure is a critical component of the TOM, as it defines how people and teams are organized to deliver the functional capabilities and services. We design a structure that balances the need for specialization and collaboration, with clear lines of reporting, decision-making, and accountability. This may involve creating new roles or teams, realigning existing ones, or establishing centers of excellence or shared services. The organizational structure is designed to enable agility, innovation, and customer-centricity, while also promoting employee engagement and development.

To bring the new organizational structure to life, we define the key roles and responsibilities required for success. This includes creating detailed job descriptions that outline the skills, experience, and competencies needed for each role, as well as the expected outcomes and performance metrics. We also conduct a workforce analysis to determine the optimal headcount and capacity needed to deliver the future state capabilities, taking into account factors such as workload, skill gaps, and growth projections. This analysis informs decisions around hiring, upskilling, and talent management, ensuring that the client's IT organization has the right people in the right roles to execute the TOM.

Finally, we conduct a gap analysis between the current state and the future state TOM. This analysis highlights the key differences between where the client's IT organization is today and where it needs to be in the future, across dimensions such as capabilities, processes, technology, people, and culture. By quantifying these gaps, we can prioritize the areas that require the most attention and investment during the transition phase. The gap analysis also informs the development of a detailed implementation roadmap, which sequences the key activities and milestones required to realize the future state vision.

Overall, the Future State design phase is a highly collaborative and iterative process that engages stakeholders from across the client's IT organization and the broader company. By co-creating the Target Operating Model, we ensure that the future state vision is both ambitious and achievable, and that it has broad buy-in and ownership from the people who will be responsible for executing it. The TOM serves as a clear and compelling blueprint for the future of the client's IT organization, guiding the company towards greater impact, agility, and innovation in support of its mission.

The Roadmap and Change Management phase is critical to the success of the client's IT organizational redesign initiative, as it bridges the gap between the future state vision and the current state reality. This phase focuses on developing a comprehensive plan for implementing the Target Operating Model (TOM) and managing the complex organizational changes required to achieve the desired outcomes.

One of the key deliverables in this phase is a phased implementation roadmap. The roadmap breaks down the overall transformation into manageable stages, each with specific objectives, activities, dependencies, and timelines. The phasing is based on a careful analysis of the gaps between the current state and the future state, as well as the priorities and constraints of the organization. For example, the roadmap might begin with foundational activities such as technology upgrades or process standardization, before moving on to more complex changes such as organizational restructuring or capability building. By providing a clear and realistic path forward, the roadmap helps to build momentum and confidence in the transformation journey.

To support the implementation roadmap, we also develop detailed budgetary estimates. These estimates capture the one-time and ongoing costs associated with the transformation, including investments in technology, facilities, training, and talent. The budgetary estimates are based on a thorough analysis of the resources required to execute the roadmap, as well as benchmarks from similar transformations in other organizations. By providing transparency into the financial implications of the transformation, we help the client's IT leadership make informed decisions about resource allocation and prioritization.
